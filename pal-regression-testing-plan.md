## Purpose

The aim of this regression testing plan is to outline all of the things which will be tested on each of the environments as PAL releases progress through the deployment environments to live. This document should be modified and adapted as required by each of the testers in order to keep the document relevant and useful.

## Browser Support

Regression testing across browsers should be performed based on the [latest stats for News & World Service](https://confluence.dev.bbc.co.uk/display/news/Supported+Browser+Versions)
